<!--
	Simple Area Chart
	Area Charts are similar to line charts and are used to continous data (unlike column charts where the data is discrete).
	The area covered but the envlope ie. the line formed by joning the x, y values and the x axis is usually shaded to show
	the the cumulative(summation) effect.
